    "# Q1: What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the web page and then extracting useful information from it. Web scraping is used for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction: Gathering data from websites for analysis or integration into other systems.\n",
    "Competitor Analysis: Monitoring competitors' websites for changes in products, prices, or features.\n",
    "Content Aggregation: Collecting data from multiple sources to create a unified view or feed.\n",
    "# Q2: What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Paste: Simple but tedious, involving manually copying and pasting data from a website.\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Pattern matching to extract specific information from HTML content.\n",
    "HTML Parsing: Using libraries like Beautiful Soup or lxml to parse HTML and extract desired information.\n",
    "Web Scraping Frameworks: Utilizing frameworks like Scrapy that provide a structured way to build web scrapers.\n",
    "# Q3: What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. Beautiful Soup transforms a complex HTML document into a tree of Python objects, such as tags, navigable strings, or comments. It simplifies the process of extracting information from HTML by providing methods to navigate and search the parse tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, and it is used in web scraping projects for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "API Endpoints: Flask allows you to create API endpoints to serve scraped data.\n",
    "Web Interface: It enables building a simple web interface to interact with the scraper.\n",
    "Integration: Flask can be easily integrated with web scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup to create a complete web application for data extraction.\n",
    "# Q5: Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical web scraping project deployed on AWS, you might use several services, depending on the requirements. Some common services include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. You can use EC2 instances to run web scraping scripts and host web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Used for storing and retrieving any amount of data. It's suitable for storing scraped data or serving static files in a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Offers managed database services, allowing you to store structured data. It can be used to store scraped data in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Lambda: Allows running code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda functions for scheduled scraping tasks or to process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon API Gateway: Enables the creation and management of APIs. You can use API Gateway to expose your web scraping results via RESTful APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch: Provides monitoring and logging services. It helps in monitoring the performance of your web scraping scripts or web applications."
